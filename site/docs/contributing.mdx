# Contributing

<LargeParagraph>
    You can contribute content in different ways to HDS. This section gives you all the information needed to get started.
</LargeParagraph>

## Before contributing

Note that everything added to HDS has to have **design, implementation and documentation**. You may contribute only part of these but please note that HDS team has to implement all three parts before the feature can be released. 

Before you start contributing to HDS, please refer to following guidelines.

### Tools needed
Depending on the feature you want to be working on, you will need access at least some of these tools:
- <Link href="https://www.sketch.com/" external>Sketch</Link>
- City of Helsinki <Link href="https://www.abstract.com/" external>Abstract</Link>
- City of Helsinki Slack (channel <Link href="https://helsinkicity.slack.com/archives/CHCV3KTHA" external>#designsystem</Link>)
- <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system" external>HDS GitHub repository</Link>

### Process of adding new components

<Image src="../../static/hds-contribution-simple.png" alt="How to contribute to Helsinki Design System" style="max-width:100%" viewable />

Answer the following three questions to find out whether you should propose a new component.

#### 1. Does it already exist?
Before you start working or proposing a new component, it is important to check whether it already exists in HDS or in our roadmap.

- **First**, check if it exists in [HDS components](/components).
- **Second**, check if it exists on [HDS roadmap](/about/roadmap).
- **Third**, check if someone else has already <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/issues" external>proposed it in GitHub issues</Link>.

#### 2. If not, how easily could a existing component be altered to fulfill new requirements?
Go through the list of existing [HDS components](/components). See if some of the components could be slightly altered to suit your needs while still fulfilling existing requirements. If yes, move on to [making a proposal for the change]().

#### 3. If not, is this component something that is needed in several projects?
Think outside of the scope of your project. Can this component be utilized in other projects as well? If not, could you make it something more generic to match needs of other projects? Discuss with other projects and community.

## Design

<p>HDS design versions are managed in City of Helsinki Abstract, in a project called Helsinki Design System. The design assets are also available as a kit which is downloadable from the official <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases" external>HDS repository releases</Link>.</p>

There are two ways of proposing new designs to be added to HDS.

### Opening a new branch to Abstract repository

If you have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create branch from Master branch. Branch name should follow naming convention [Your name] - [Component name], for example "John Doe - Dropdown"
- Add all sufficient designs related to your proposals to their own file named HDS [Component name], for example "HDS Dropdown".
- When done, make a commit, along with a description of what changes were made, your component, how should your component be used and where (give an example layout if possible).
- Last, submit branch for review and add both Roni Jaakkola and Eemeli Nieminen as reviewers. They will provide feedback and suggest changes if needed.

**Do not merge** your branch to Master. HDS team will do it if the feature is accepted.

### Creating an issue to GitHub repository

If you do not have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create an issue in HDS GitHub repository. Use the component name as issue name and label it as "feature-request".
- In issue body, follow "What & why" issue template when writing the issue. Be specific.
- You may attach a Sketch file containing the designs to the issue. You can also attach reference screenshots to illustrate your proposal better.

## Implementation

<p>When contributing for implementation, create <Link href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" external>pull request</Link> to <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system" external>HDS GitHub repository</Link>.</p>

### Guidelines for implementation

_Coming soon!_

## Documentation

### Cloning repository and setting up local environment

<p>When contributing for documentation, it is recommended to set up a local development environment. This allows you to view changes you make in real time. Refer to <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/site#setting-up-local-development-environment" external>site project GitHub README</Link> for easy instructions how to set up the local development envinroment.</p>

### Guidelines for writing documentation

<p>After the local deveopment environment is set up, editing documentation and adding new pages is simple. Refer to <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/site#writing-documentation" external>site project GitHub README</Link> for general documentation guidelines and instructions on how to create new pages and categories.</p>
