<p>HDS design versions are managed in City of Helsinki Abstract, in a project called Helsinki Design System. The design assets are also available as a kit which is downloadable from the official <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases" external>HDS repository releases</Link>.</p>

## Proposing a design
There are two ways of proposing new designs to be added to HDS.

### Opening a new branch to Abstract repository

If you have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create branch from Master branch. Branch name should follow naming convention [Your name] - [Component name], for example "John Doe - Dropdown"
- Add all sufficient designs related to your proposals to their own file named HDS [Component name], for example "HDS Dropdown".
- When done, make a commit, along with a description of what changes were made, your component, how should your component be used and where (give an example layout if possible).
- Last, submit branch for review and add both Roni Jaakkola and Eemeli Nieminen as reviewers. They will provide feedback and suggest changes if needed.

**Do not merge** your branch to Master. HDS team will do it if the feature is accepted.

### Creating an issue to GitHub repository

If you do not have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create an issue in HDS GitHub repository. Use the component name as issue name and label it as "feature-request".
- In issue body, follow "What & why" issue template when writing the issue. Be specific.
- You may attach a Sketch file containing the designs to the issue. You can also attach reference screenshots to illustrate your proposal better.

## Guidelines for naming HDS design files

### Symbol naming naming and folder structure
The symbol naming and folder structure of HDS Sketch libraries is based on hierarchical **CTI (Category-Type-Item) naming practice**. The CTI taxonomy acts as a tool to help decide this hierarchy of symbols.

#### Library name
- ***HDS [Library name]*** is usually the same as the **_Item_ name of the** in singular form (for example `HDS Button`).
- If several items are grouped in one library, the **_Category_ of the items** is used instead (for example `HDS Typography`, `HDS Form Components`).

### Symbol hierarchy

#### Folders
The component symbols and token styles should be sorted into folders in descending order of complexity in following hierarchy: 

`Category`/`Type`/`Item`/`Sub item`/`Variant(s)`/`State`

- ***Category*** defines the primitive nature of a property. For example every property in the Color category is always a color.
- ***Type*** is a sub-category only applied to property tokens. For example Color types are Fill, Border and UI State.
- ***Item*** is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own, for example a **React component** (`Button`, `Dropdown`) or **Token** (`Black`, `White`). 
- ***Sub-item*** are standalone variants of items (for example Button component has sub-items `01 Primary`, `02 Secondary`, `03 Supplementary`).
- ***Variant(s)*** are interchangeable symbol versions where some attribute of the item is changed (for example _size, layout, colour tint, font weight, breakpoint size, functionality…_). Variants can be for example `400 Regular`, `500 Medium`… or . `Left`, `Right`
  - An item can have several levels of variants.
  - Variant levels should preferably be sorted in descending order of scale: 
    - *Theme* (light/dark)
    - *Role* (functionality, feature)
    - *Breakpoint* (HDS brakepoints)
    - *Size* (small, medium, large…)
    - *Shape* (horzontal/vertical)
    - *Position*/orientation (left/center/right, top/middle/bottom)
    - *Content* (parts) 
    - *Layout* (alignment and position of content/parts) 
    - *Appearance* (fill, border, status, font weight…)
  - ***State*** is a variant of a component caused by user interaction. For example Hover, Active, Disabled, Open, Closed etc.


#### Suffixes
- ***- modifier*** can be used to differentiate same level variants and states of items.
  - Modifiers are separated from the variant name with a *dash* `-` (for example `01 Default - 1 row`, `01 Default - 2 rows`...).
  - If a modifier adds something to the variant, a *plus sign* `+`  can be used instead (for example `01 Selection`, `02 Selection + text`…).
  - A modifier should be in *all lower case*.
  - If the variant hierarchy is particularly complex, variation levels can be added as modifiers to helps differentiating variations in the Sketch symbol menu (for example Body text variant `Body S - Regular - 01 Black - Center`).
- ***(Clarifying information)*** can be added in the end of the name within parentheses ( ). For example the specific pixel size of a spacing token.

#### Internal symbol folders
- ***x_Parts*** and ***x_Sections*** are helper symbols used only to enable customising component symbols in Sketch. They are not in themselves usable as components.
  - *Parts* are elements needed for building overrides and larger nested symbols, but are not in standalone items. 
  - *Sections* are larger customisable blocks of complex components that need to be overridable in Sketch.
  - Internal symbols are grouped in `x_Parts` and `x_Sections` folders, at the root level of the library.
  - The `x_` prefix keeps folders at the bottom of the symbol menu.
- ***xx_Deprecated***
  - Old versions of items that are going to be replaced in future but are still supported, are grouped into a folder `xx_Deprecated` on the root level of the library.
  - The `xx_` prefix keeps folders at the bottom of the menu, even bellow `x_Parts` and `x_Sections`.

#### Pages
- **All symbols of one component** are grouped on `[Component name]` page.
  - Symbols are aligned and organised on the page in clear groupings.
- **Examples of available variations** of the component should be presented with `Example` arboards.
  - Example artboard name should state the component or feature introduced (for example `Example - Responsive sizes`).
  - Single component libraries, example artboards are grouped on `Examples` page.
  - In libraries with more than one component, example artboards can be grouped in the `[Component name]`  page together with component symbols.
- Additional instructions about the using of Sketch symbols can be documented on Instructions artboards. For example Instructions - Footer sections.
  - If the library has instructions, they can be groped on the same page with examples named Examples & Instructions.
- Internal symbols are grouped on x_Parts and x_Sections pages.
- If the component has may different sections, each section can be grouped to their own page (for example `x_Section - Navigation`).
- Deprecated symbols are grouped on xx_Deprecated page.
