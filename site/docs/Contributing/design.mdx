<p>HDS design versions are managed in City of Helsinki Abstract, in a project called Helsinki Design System. The design assets are also available as a kit which is downloadable from the official <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases" external>HDS repository releases</Link>.</p>

## Proposing a design
There are two ways of proposing new designs to be added to HDS.

### Opening a new branch to Abstract repository

If you have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create branch from Master branch. Branch name should follow naming convention [Your name] - [Component name], for example "John Doe - Dropdown"
- Add all sufficient designs related to your proposals to their own file named HDS [Component name], for example "HDS Dropdown".
- When done, make a commit, along with a description of what changes were made, your component, how should your component be used and where (give an example layout if possible).
- Last, submit branch for review and add both Roni Jaakkola and Eemeli Nieminen as reviewers. They will provide feedback and suggest changes if needed.

**Do not merge** your branch to Master. HDS team will do it if the feature is accepted.

### Creating an issue to GitHub repository

If you do not have an access to City of Helsinki Abstract and HDS repository, you can 
- Create an issue in HDS GitHub repository. Use the component name as issue name and label it as "feature-request".
- In issue body, follow "What & why" issue template when writing the issue. Be specific.
- You may attach a Sketch file containing the designs to the issue. You can also attach reference screenshots to illustrate your proposal better.
