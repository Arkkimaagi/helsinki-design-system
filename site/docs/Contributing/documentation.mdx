# Contributing to Documentation

<LargeParagraph>
    Documentation is an essential part of HDS. In addition to component specific documentation, HDS provides broader guidelines, instructionsand patterns for creating City of Helsinki  digital services.
</LargeParagraph>

When contributing for documentation, there are a couple of ways of doing it

### Editing pages directly in GitHub website

The easiest way to edit a page is with the Edit this page on Github link that appears at the bottom of every page on the site. The link opens the specific Github page where you can edit the content and propose the change with a pull request.

### Forking repository and setting up local environment

<p>If you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates, you will want to fork the repository and install some of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier workflow for you long term. Follow README in <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/site" external>documentation site package</Link> to get you started setting up local development environment.</p>
