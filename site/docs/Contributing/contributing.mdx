# Before contributing

<LargeParagraph>
    You can contribute content in different ways to HDS. This section gives you all the information needed to get started.
</LargeParagraph>
Before you start contributing to HDS, please refer to following guidelines.

Every component in HDS comprises of three parts:
1. Design 
2. Implementation 
3. Documentation 

You may contribute only part of these but please note that all three parts have to be implemented and validated by HDS team before a feature can be released.

## Tools needed
Depending on the feature you want to be working on, you will need access at least some of these tools:
- <Link href="https://www.sketch.com/" external>Sketch</Link>
- City of Helsinki <Link href="https://www.abstract.com/" external>Abstract</Link>
- City of Helsinki Slack (channel <Link href="https://helsinkicity.slack.com/archives/CHCV3KTHA" external>#designsystem</Link>)
- <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system" external>HDS GitHub repository</Link>

Answer the following three questions to find out whether you should propose a new component.

### 1. Does it already exist?
Before you start working or proposing a new component, it is important to check whether it already exists in HDS or in our roadmap.
- **First**, check if it exists in [HDS components](/components).
- **Second**, check if it exists on [HDS roadmap](/about/roadmap).
- **Third**, check if someone else has already <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/issues" external>proposed it in GitHub issues</Link>.

### 2. If not, how easily could a existing component be altered to fulfill new requirements?
Go through the list of existing [HDS components](/components). See if some of the components could be slightly altered to suit your needs while still fulfilling existing requirements. If yes, move on to [making a proposal for the change]().

### 3. If not, is this component something that is needed in several projects?
Think outside of the scope of your project. Can this component be utilized in other projects as well? If not, could you make it something more generic to match needs of other projects? Discuss with other projects and community.
