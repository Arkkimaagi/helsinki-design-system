# Loading spinner

<LargeParagraph>
  Loading spinner is used for notifying users that their action is being processed or data retrieved from server.
</LargeParagraph>

The loading spinner do not provide details about nature of the processing, but it reassures the user that their action is being processed.

## Principles
- Use the loading spinner only if the wait time is anticipated to be longer than three seconds. A spinner that just flashes quickly in view can confuse the user.
- Display the loading spinner in the same area and contextual level where the processing is taking place. For example if only the loader indicates that data is being retrieved for a specific content area, display the spinner in that same area.
- If possible, provide a descpriptive label for the action being processed with the loading spinner.


## Accessibility
- The colour contrast between the loading spinner and its background must comply with <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. You can find more information about accessible color combinations in [Colour design token documentation](/design-tokens/colour).


## Usage and variations

The loading spinner comes in two sizes: 
- Medium (64px) is used for larger content areas and full screen loading 
- Small (24px) can be used for indicating more local changes in content.

The colour of the spinner can also be customised to fit the colour theme of the service.
