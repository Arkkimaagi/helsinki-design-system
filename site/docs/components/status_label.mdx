# Status label

<LargeParagraph>
  Status labels can be used to highlight different statuses or items to the user. Status labels cannot be interacted with and they are only meant to convey relevant information.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles

- **A label should always be provided with a status label.**
- Keep labels short and concise. Use 1-2 words at maximum and do not use labels expanding to two rows.
- Use status colours consistenly. You can find guidelines on when to use each status colour in the [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour#ui-colours "UI colours").

## Accessibility

- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- Remember that colour should never be the only way of conveying information. Make sure the meaning of the status label is clearly described by the label text. Refer to <Link href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html" external>WCAG 2.1 Use of Color guideline</Link> for more information.
