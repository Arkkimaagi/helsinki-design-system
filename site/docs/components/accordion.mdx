<LargeParagraph>
    Accordions can be used to hide and reveal information. When used correctly, they are a good way to make higher amount of information easier to digest for the user.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- Use accordions to allow the user to quickly glance the information and then choose to open sections that are interesting to them.
- **Accordions must be given a header which describes the accordion content.** This header also acts as the label for the expand button. The header level can be chosen depending on the structure of the page.
- **Do not put essential or must-read information inside accordions.** If the user is expected to open all of the accordions while using the service, then it is likely that the information should not be inside accordions at all.
- Do not use accordions to create step-by-step forms. You must not expect that the user opens all accordions in a specific order.
- Accordions should initially be closed when the page is loaded.
- Expanding or closing the accordion should only affect to the related accordion area. You also should not auto-close or auto-open accordions.

## Accessibility
- Use HDS provided accordion elements when creating custom accordions. These elements pass accessibility testing.
- When creating custom accordions, make sure that the expanded accordion area directly follows the accordion button in the DOM tree.
    - If you must place the accordion area somewhere else, use `aria-owns` attribute to indicate the relationship. However, be aware that this attribute does not necessarily work with all screen readers.
- Make sure that the keyboard user is able to navigate out of the accordion area without closing the accordion. See <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#no-keyboard-trap" external>WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap guideline</Link> for more information.
