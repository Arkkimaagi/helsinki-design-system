# Footer

<LargeParagraph>
  The footer component is
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles

- **It is strongly recommended to always include the footer component in your service.**
- Always position footer to the bottom of the page. It is recommended to include footer on every page of the service.
- Footer component is built to follow HDS [breakpoint tokens](/design-tokens/breakpoints). While it is recommended to follow HDS breakpoint tokens, you may alter footer width to fit your service's needs.
- **It is recommended that the footer includes at least navigation and base sections. The Utility section can be omitted if not needed** 
- Keep the order of footer sections (navigation, utility, base) and actions inside sections consistent. Do not change the default order without a good reason.
- The footer navigation should follow the same structure and labelling as the primary navigation. All top level pages included in the primary navigation should also be visible in footer navigation.  
- Sub-pages can either be included or omitted from the footer navigation. If sub-pages are included in footer, they should follow the same structure and labelling as in the primary navigation. All same level sub-pages should be visible. See Navigation section usage, for more information about possible variations of footer navigation.

## Accessibility

- HDS Footer is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing the footer link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element.

## Usage and variations
The Footer consists of three sections: navigation, utility and base. Each section is customisable to fit the diverse needs of different services. Footer should always have at least Navigation, and Base sections. The Utility section is optional, and can be omitted entirely if necessary. Parts of the sections can also be hidden if not needed.
- **Navigation section** contains the Helsinki framed logo, the name of the service and footer navigation. Navigation section variations for more information about customising the footer navigation.
- **Utility section** contains links and actions not listed in main navigation. For example social media icons, and links to contact info, feedback, or back to top.
- **Base section** is used for supplementary information, For example copyright information and links to accessibility statement, privacy policy, terms of use, etc.

The background colour and koro motif can also be customised.

### Default
The default footer uses the black text colour variant and includes all three sections. 
- The navigation section shows the Helsinki framed logo, service name and navigation. Navigation is optimised for up to eight menu items. 
- Utility section is optimised to display up to five social media icons and three action links. An icon can be added to action links.
- Base section includes text field for copyright or other meta information and is optimised for up to five supplementary links, depending on link length.
