## City of Helsinki and accessibility

xxx (TBD: What is accessibility and how/where do we apply it)

EU directive on web accessibility mandates that all new public sector websites published by September 23 2019 has to comply with WCAG 2.0 Standard at AA Level. On September 23 2020 all websites, new and old, has to meet this criteria. In addition, City of Helsinki has its own content accessibility guidelines for the web (only in Finnish for now). Internationally we talk about a11y.

**In a nutshell, content should be**

- Perceivable (content can be seen in many ways)
- Operable (usable as intended)
- Understandable (not too hard to use)
- Robust (accessible by wide range of technologies, including old and new browsers).

## Global accessibility standards

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people of all abilities.
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which is the global accessibility standard.
