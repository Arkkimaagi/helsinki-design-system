## Standards
### Global accessibility standards
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)â€™s [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ "W3C Web Accessibility Initiative") is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people of all abilities.
The WAI contributors maintain [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ "WCAG 2.0 Guidelines"), which is the global accessibility standard.

[The international A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/ "The A11Y Project") is a community-driven effort to make web accessibility easier.

### Accessibility in the City of Helsinki digital services
[EU directive on web accessibility](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj "EU directive on web accessibility") mandates that all new public sector websites published by September 23 2019 have to comply with [WCAG 2.0 Standard at AA Level](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance "WCAG 2.0 Standard at AA Level"). On September 23 2020 all websites, new and old, have to meet this criteria. 

The City of Helsinki also has its own [content accessibility guidelines](https://www.hel.fi/static/liitteet/kanslia/TPR/opas_saavutettavaan_sisaltoon_EN.pdf) for the web.

[Develop with Helsinki](https://dev.hel.fi/accessibility) site offers quality content about accessibility for developers.


## Principles
The WCAG 2.0 Accessibility Standard outlines [four principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines "WCAG 2.0 Principles") for what an accessible service should be:
- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. For example by providing text alternates to visual and time-based media.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable, for example with keyboard and assistive technologies. It should help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
- **Understandable**: the content should be readable and easy to understand, and the services should operate in a predictable way.
- **Robust**: accessible by wide range of technologies, including old and new browsers and assistive technologies.

A few guidelines for developing accessible services:
- Write standards compliant, semantic HTML and CSS
- Support keyboard navigation and other standard accessibility functionalities
- In React, use ARIA when there is no native markup. For more information, see [React accessibility documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html)
