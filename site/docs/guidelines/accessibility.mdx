## City of Helsinki and accessibility

[EU directive on web accessibility](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj) mandates that all new public sector websites published by September 23 2019 have to comply with [WCAG 2.0 Standard at AA Level](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance). On September 23 2020 all websites, new and old, have to meet this criteria. In addition, City of Helsinki has its own [content accessibility guidelines for the web](https://www.hel.fi/static/hki4all/ohjeet/saavutettavuus-opas.pdf) (only in Finnish for now). Internationally we talk about [a11y](https://a11yproject.com/).

In a nutshell, content should be

- **Perceivable**: content can be seen in many ways
- **Operable** usable as intended
- **Understandable** not too hard to use
- **Robust** accessible by wide range of technologies, including old and new browsers.

**General principles**
- Write standards compliant, semantic HTML and CSS
- Support keyboard navigation and other standard accessibility functionalities
- In [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html), use ARIA when there is no native markup.

## Global accessibility standards

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)â€™s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people of all abilities.
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which is the global accessibility standard.
