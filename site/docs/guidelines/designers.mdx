# Designer Guidelines

---

Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The HDS kit contains all the resources you need to get started.

## Workflow with Sketch + Abstract:

The Master _'Helsinki Design System'_ is the single point of reference for your design.

You won't be making edits or iterations directly to the Master.
**QUESTION:** is there a set-up for making tests/exploration? Another project in Abstract?

1. To add designs to the design system, start by creating a Branch either from the Master or another branch (the branches are named 'Your name DDMMYYYY'). Do this with _“Create a branch”_ feature within the Helsinki Design System project in Abstract.
2. When you're done with your edits, make a commit, alsong with a short description of what changes were made, and ask the Design lead to review the design >> via the green button _“Request review”_ in Abstract.
3. After your design has been approved, merge your branch. A merge combines the separate edits you did into either the Master directly, or another Branch. >> via the blue button _“Merge Branch”_.

After a Merge, you'll end up with an updated Master (or Branch), and an archived old Branch.

## Symbols

HDS components, add-ons, and icons live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

### Library menu navigation

There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select _Symbols → HDS [component name]_ to add symbols onto your page.
Helsinki Design System symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

### Structure

Symbols are organised by component; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

- To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your Artboard.
- ((For even more configurability, use the individual building blocks found under the Items folder within the symbol. Be sure your custom design adheres to our design guidelines.))

## Text styles

### Library menu navigation

From the main menu select Insert → Text Styles → HDS Typography to insert a text style.
Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.
