We are also committed to complying with AA standard contrast ratios. To do this, choose primary, secondary, and extended colours that support usability by ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use the interface.  
  
## Brand colours:  
  
### Primary colour (define per service)  
A primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your services and components.  
If you donâ€™t have a secondary color, your primary color can also be used to accent elements.  

### Secondary colour (define per service)  
A secondary colour provides more ways to accent and distinguish your service. The secondary colour should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI.

### Extended  
The extended palette consists of all the usable tints and shades of each colour in the palette. Usage of these colours varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for illustrations and components in product.
