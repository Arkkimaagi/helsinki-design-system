# Design Principles

---

  
We always keep the core principles in mind, when making design decisions. We encourage you to follow the same principles.  
  
**Modular and flexible:** All components are designed to work seamlessly with one another and help people work smarter, better and faster.
**Consistent:** All components are designed to work together to ensure consistent and cohesive user experience.
**Accessibility baked-in:** Accessibility is part of the process from start to end. It is designed to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.
