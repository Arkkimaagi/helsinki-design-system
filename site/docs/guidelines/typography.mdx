## Type style

We use Bold or Regular as font weights.

Bold is used in headers and subheader as well as to emphasize text.  
Regular is used for body text and Links.  
Medium is used only in button components.

## Type color

Use black or white as text color depending on the background color. We advise to use other colors as text color sparingly if at all.
