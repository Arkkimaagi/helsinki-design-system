# Guidelines for localisation
<LargeParagraph>
    Localising services for different languages makes City of Helsinki services more approachable and easy to understand for wider audiences.
</LargeParagraph>

Here are some recommendations for localising content and navigation:

- **The default language of Helsinki digital services is Finnish (FI).**
  - It is recommended that Helsinki digital services follow Finnish date and time locale even if the user is using some other language. See the [HDS data format guidelines](/guidelines/data-formats "HDS data format guidelines") for more information.
- **Content should also be provided at least in Swedish (SV) and English (EN), if possible.**
  - Finnish (FI), Swedish (SV) and English (EN) languages should be treated as equal in content and language menus. For these languages it is recommended to provide full content.
  - For English (EN) locale, British English spelling should be used.
  - For Swedish (SV) locale, the Helsingfors version of the framed logo should be used. Other languages use the default Helsinki framed logo. See more in the [logo guidelines](/visual-assets/logo "HDS Visual assets logo guidelines"). 
- **Additional languages**, sign language and plain language versions of content can be added depending on the targeted user group of the service. The content provided in additional languages can be a subset or a summary of the main content.


- **Let the user select their preferred language.**
  - Do not auto-localise content or menus unless the user has picked a default language for them self. 
  - For logged in users the language selection can be a stored in user information.
  - For non logged in users, the selection made in language picker can be stored with a cookie.
- **When the user switches languages, the page context should be preserved.**
  - When user switches language on a sub page, the corresponding page should be shown, instead of redirecting the user to front page.
  - If a localised version of the content is not available, it is recommended to inform the user and provide possible next actions, instead of redirecting to front page.
- **The preferred method for switching languages is with the language picker action in [HDS Navigation component](/components/navigation "HDS Navigation component documentation").**
  - If there are less than three available languages and the services navigation is simple, available languages can be listed as links in the navigation bar action row instead of a language select dropdown.
- **Use language code (`FI`, `SV`, `EN`...) to represent locales**
  - Do not use flags. Languages are not always country specific.
  - The currently selected language (for example in navigation language picker) can be indicated with language code alone.
  - When listing languages for selection it is advised to also write out the locale in it's corresponding language. Here are some common example locales:
