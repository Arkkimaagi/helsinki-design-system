# Grid

<LargeParagraph>
    Helsinki Design System follows a 12 column grid system which scales across five defined breakpoints. Using pre-defined grid system helps to keep visual consistency and rhythm across your designs and implementations.
</LargeParagraph>

**Note! HDS does not currently include any implementation of the grid. Grid is provided as specified breakpoints and other values which can be easily applied to most commonly used grid systems.**

## Grid in different breakpoints

The following table presents how HDS grid behaves and changes in different breakpoints. You can read more about breakpoint and container width tokens [here](/design-tokens/breakpoints).

Breakpoint token | Container-width token | # of columns | Margin (gutter) in px
-----------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------
--breakpoint-xs  | --container-width-xs  | 4            | 12
--breakpoint-s   | --container-width-s   | 4            | 16
--breakpoint-m   | --container-width-m   | 8            | 24
--breakpoint-l   | --container-width-l   | 12           | 24
--breakpoint-xl  | --container-width-xl  | 12           | 24
