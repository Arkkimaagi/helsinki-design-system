## Introduction

Helsinki Design System is an open-source design system for digital products and experiences. It provides components and tools to help product teams work more efficiently, and to make all websites of Helsinki City more cohesive.

The component library was designed to help developers quickly create the best experience for City of Helsinki’s digital services.

Each component includes information to help you implement them:

- Description and general guideline of the component
- Best practices to use the component correctly
- Interactive examples so you can see the component in action

## For Designers

Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The HDS kit contains all the resources you need to get started.

**Start** with the following:

1. Explore the [designer guidelines](guidelines/designers) to learn the Helsinki City product design patterns and principles.
2. Take a look at the Components section, to see what’s there and how you can incorporate those into your designs.
3. To start taking those into use, go to Abstract, set up your project and link the desired HDS library files (Helsinki Design System) to your project and sketch file.
4. If you have a component that isn’t yet part of the Design System, propose it to the HDS team via a ‘review request’. The Lead Designer will review the design and also present it to the CXO (Jukka) and the brand manager (Hannamari). When Lead Designer approves the design, add your design to the library. Afterwards, communicate with the developers of your team about developing the component.

## For Developers

Helsinki Design System provides a collection of ready-made components for building accessible websites and applications that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language.
