# Icons

<LargeParagraph>The HDS icon library is a set of icons specially designed for use in digital user interfaces. </LargeParagraph>

> **Work in progress!**
> 
> Possible upcoming changes to brand guidelines due to accessibility improvements. These can also affect design principles and visual style of icons.

**The HDS icon library** follows the icon style defined in the Helsinki city brand guidelines, but the forms of the icons are simplified and adjusted for legibility in smaller sizes and pixel resolutions. Some icons have been added to the icon library additionally to the ones defined in the brand work, to make it easier to create easily understandable user interfaces.


## Principles
Icons can bring an interface to life, giving additional meaning and providing visual cues for action. However, there are some considerations for their usage: 
- **Icons are not a decoration:** icons should always serve a distinct, easily understandable purpose. 
- **The meaning of icons can be ambiguous:** icons shoud preferably be accompanied with a text label to give context. 


## Usage
### Icon types
The HDS icon library consists of four different types of icons for different purposes:

1. **UI icons** are mainly intented for providing visual cues for interaction, increasing discoverability and learnability. The UI icons can be used for example in buttons or navigation. Using UI icons for purely decorative purposes and illustration should be avoided.
2. **Illustrative icons** are more decorative and playful. They are intented for illustrating concepts and services.
3. **Pictograms** are more complex icon styled pictures for illustrating concepts, services and processes.
4. **SoMe icons** are logos of Helsinki city social media channels and digital services as ways of logging in. 

### Size
The default size of the HDS icons is 24 × 24 px.
- If needed, other sizes matching the HDS layout spacing can also be used.
- When using the icons in 16 × 16 px, make sure the icon is still clear and legible.
- Larger sizes than 64 × 64 px are not recommended

### Colour
The default colour of the HDS icons is black or white, depending on the background. 
- Other colours should be used sparingly and mostly used for highlighting errors or other system status.
- The colour contrast with background must comply with [AA Level contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast "WCAG 2.0 Visual and audio contrast").
- See [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") for further information.
