<!---
Import all the needed components from HDS libraries.
-->
import { <COMPONENT_NAME> } from "hds-react";

<!---
Import documentation specific components. You can view what is available in /site/src/components/ folder.

import LargeParagraph from "../../src/components/LargeParagraph";

# <COMPONENT_NAME>

<LargeParagraph>
    <!---
    With a couple of sentences, describe the component and its main use cases.
    -->
</LargeParagraph>

<!---
If you want to add more introductory content, you can do that below LargeParagraph section. Keep this relatively short and simple.

## Principles

<!---
Principles section lists the most important fundamentals about using the component. Generally, HDS documentation tends not to list basic level usability principles in component documentation. Instead, try to provide concise principles on how to and how not to use the component in real world user interfaces. A good starting point is to check other components' documentation for examples.

Principles are listed as separate bullet points. You may bold part of the sentences to highlight the most important principles.
- <ADD PRINCIPLE HERE>
- <ADD PRINCIPLE HERE>
-->

## Accessibility
<!---
Accessibility section lists the most important principles related to accessibility. A good rule of thumb is that every principle in this section should have a point of reference in WCAG 2.1 documentation and provide a link to that reference. If you do not have experience about accessibility, you can contact the HDS team and we will guide you forward.

Accessibility principles are listed as separate bullet points. You may bold part of the sentences to highlight the most important principles.
