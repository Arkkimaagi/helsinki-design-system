## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- The Error Summary must be given a label
- If errors are found in the form, the error summary component is created and placed at the beginning of the form, below the initial form heading.
- The focus is moved from the form submit button to the error summary heading by using either the `autofocus` property or by other means.
- The error summary is populated with a list of errors found in the form. Errors are in the same order as they appear in the form. For each error, a running number and an error description are provided. The error description also acts as an anchor link.
- The user can use the error description anchor link to quickly jump and focus each of the erroneous inputs.
- The colour contrast between the Error Summary and its background must comply with <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">WCAG AA Level contrast ratios</ExternalLink>. If needed, you may use a border to increase the contrast to its background.
