## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- Heading levels must be in hierarchial order. `Hero.Title` is rendered as a `<h1>` element by default. It can be changed with the `headingLevel` property of the `Hero.Title`
- The hero component itself is not interactable so it does not have a focus state.
- Images in the hero component are hidden from assistive technologies and have an empty alt-text
