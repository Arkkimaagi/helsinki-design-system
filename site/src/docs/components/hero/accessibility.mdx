## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- Heading levels must be in hierarchical order. `Hero.Title` is rendered as a `<h1>` element by default. It can be changed with the `headingLevel` property of the `Hero.Title`.
- The hero component is not interactable and does not have a focus state.
- If the Hero's CTA button is used as a link, remember to set 'role="link"' to the button.
- Images in the hero component are hidden from assistive technologies and have an empty alt-text.
