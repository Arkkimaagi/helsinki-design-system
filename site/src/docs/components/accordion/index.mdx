## Usage

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Accordion heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
</PlaygroundPreview>

### Principles

- Use accordions to allow the user to quickly glance at the information and then choose to open sections that are interesting to them.
- **Accordions must be given a header that describes the accordion content.** This header also acts as the label for the expand button. The header level can be chosen depending on the structure of the page.
  - The `headingLevel` given to the Accordion should be higher than the header in the page content preceeding it (if there is one). Making the content semantically correct. For example if the Accordion is nested inside content with a header `h2` then the `headingLevel` for the Accordion should be 3.
  - Also the Accordion size variant should be chosen so that it nicely fits the content, not putting a really large sized Accordion deep in the page structure.
- **Do not put essential or must-read information inside accordions.** If the user is expected to open all of the accordions while using the service, then it is likely that the information should not be inside accordions.
  - Accordions work well when the user usually needs only part of the information. You may also consider placing parts of lower importance inside accordions while the most important parts are always visible.
- By default, accordions include a close button that is visible at the bottom of an expanded accordion. This is meant to allow the user to close the accordion quickly if needed.
  - The close button can be hidden with the `closeButton` property. While it is recommended to include the button, it can be left out in accordions with very little content.
- Do not use accordions to create step-by-step forms. You must not expect that the user opens all accordions in a specific order.
- It is recommended to have accordions closed when the page is loaded.
  - If you need to have the accordion initially open, you can use the `initiallyOpen` property to achieve this.
  - Having an accordion initially open could be needed e.g. when the user returns to a page and you want to retain accordions' states.
  - Accordions should initially be closed when the page is loaded.
- Expanding or closing the accordion should only affect the related accordion area. You also should not auto-close or auto-open accordions.

### Variations

#### Default

Basic HDS Accordions provide two different visuals to choose from. These implementations are easy to take into use if you do not need any special functionality or styling.

This style is visually less distracting and it works well when there are multiple accordions one below another or nearby.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Accordion heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### With a card

You can also use HDS Cards as a container for your Accordions. Cards offer the same customizability options as default HDS Cards. To learn more about Cards and their customization, refer to <InternalLink href="/components/card">HDS Card documentation.</InternalLink>

If you have multiple accordions one below another or many accordions in the same view, consider using the visually more light [default styling variant](#default) instead of this one.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Accordion card border heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### With the close button hidden

In accordions that have very little content the close button does not offer much utility to the user. In these cases the button can be hidden with the `closeButton` property.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Accordion heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>  
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Accordion size variants

HDS Accordion includes three (3) size variants; small, default, and large. You can use different sizes depending on the screen size or use case. Use the `size` property to alter the size.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Accordion size="s" card border heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion size="m" card border heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px', marginTop: 'var(--spacing-s)' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion size="l" card border heading="How to publish data?" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px', marginTop: 'var(--spacing-s)' }}>
    To publish your data, open your profile settings and click the button 'Publish'.
  </Accordion>
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Accordions, heading elements and `headingLevel`-property

When using multiple Accordions as a group with a common header or the page content has a header preceeding the Accordion(s) remember to use the `headingLevel` property accordingly.

Keep in mind the basics of using the header elements, h1 being the most important header on the page down to h6 being the least important and give the Accordion a higher (semantically lower) `headingLevel` than the content's header the Accordion is nested in.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <h5>Header element for the content in which the following Accordions are nested in. (Here this is an h5 element)</h5>
  <Accordion headingLevel="6" size="s" card border heading="headingLevel 6" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}>
    This is an Accordion with headingLevel 6
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion headingLevel="6" size="s" card border heading="headingLevel 6" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px', marginTop: 0, borderTop: 0 }}>
    This is an Accordion with headingLevel 6
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion headingLevel="6" size="s" card border heading="headingLevel 6" language="en" style={{ maxWidth: '360px', marginTop: 0, borderTop: 0 }}>
    This is an Accordion with headingLevel 6
  </Accordion>
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Custom accordion

If the basic accordion components do not fit your needs, you can build a custom accordion by using HDS provided accordion elements.

export const AccordionExample = () => {
  const initiallyOpen = false;
  const { isOpen, buttonProps, contentProps } = useAccordion({ initiallyOpen });
  const icon = isOpen ? <IconAngleUp aria-hidden /> : <IconAngleDown aria-hidden />;
  return (
    <>
      <Button iconLeft={icon} {...buttonProps}>
        Advanced filters
      </Button>
      <Card border aria-label="Advanced filters" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--spacing-m)' }} {...contentProps}>
        <Select
          multiselect
          label="Filter by event category"
          placeholder="No selected categories"
          options={[{ label: 'Culture & arts' }, { label: 'Sports' }, { label: 'Museums' }, { label: 'Music' }]}
          clearButtonAriaLabel="Clear all selections"
          selectedItemRemoveButtonAriaLabel="Remove"
          style={{ maxWidth: '360px' }}
        />
        <Select
          multiselect
          label="Filter by event location"
          placeholder="No selected locations"
          options={[
            { label: 'Haaga' },
            { label: 'Herttoniemi' },
            { label: 'Kallio' },
            { label: 'Kamppi' },
            { label: 'Laajasalo' },
            { label: 'Lauttasaari' },
            { label: 'MellunkylÃ¤' },
            { label: 'Pasila' },
          ]}
          clearButtonAriaLabel="Clear all selections"
          selectedItemRemoveButtonAriaLabel="Remove"
          style={{ maxWidth: '360px', marginTop: 'var(--spacing-s)' }}
        />
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};
