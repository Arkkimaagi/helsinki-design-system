## Usage

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <StepByStep
    numberedList
    title="Numbered step by step component"
    helpText="Numbered list is suitable for case where the order of the steps is important."
    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description:
          "Here you can describe the step in detail. Keep the text compact so the user gets the big picture of the whole process and it's steps easily.",
        buttons: [
          {
            children: 'Example button',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
        links: [
          {
            children: 'Example link',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
      },
    ]}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>

### Principles

- The purpose of the StepByStep component is to provide an easy overall picture of a process.
- **Every step should have a title.**
- Step description is optional. The description should be compact, preferably one sentence long and two at the maximum. This is because the steps should provide a quick way to understand the whole process and too long texts can hinder that experience.
- A step can have a button as a call to action, e.g. making a phone call.
- A step can have a link to provide additional information.
- The button and the link should relate to the step's contents. We recommend having only one button or a link per step, but sometimes it could be reasonable to have two. Before adding a second button or a link, consider whether the step should be divided into two steps.

### Variations

#### Default 

The unnumbered list is useful when the order of the steps is less important and they form more of a guideline.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <StepByStep
    title="Unnumbered step by step component"
    helpText="The unnumbered list is useful when the order of the steps is less important and they form more of a guideline."
    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description:
          "Here you can describe the step in detail. Keep the text compact so the user gets the big picture of the whole process and it's steps easily.",
        buttons: [
          {
            children: 'Example button',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
        links: [
          {
            children: 'Example link',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
      },
    ]}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Numbered list

Numbered list is suitable for cases where the order of the steps is important.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <StepByStep
    numberedList
    title="Numbered step by step component"
    helpText="Numbered list is suitable for cases where the order of the steps is important."
    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description:
          "Here you can describe the step in detail. Keep the text compact so the user gets the big picture of the whole process and it's steps easily.",
        buttons: [
          {
            children: 'Example button',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
        links: [
          {
            children: 'Example link',
            href: 'https://hel.fi',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Step title',
        description: 'Step description.',
      },
    ]}
  />
