# Versions in HDS

<LeadParagraph>
  HDS follows <ExternalLink href="https://semver.org/">Semver versioning</ExternalLink>. This page describes HDS
  practices which versions are supported and what is considered as breaking changes.
</LeadParagraph>

## Which versions are supported?

HDS supports current and one previous major version. Older versions are not supported anymore. We recommend updating to the latest version.

## What is considered as a breaking change?

Breaking change can occur either in design or in the implementation or in both.

### Design

These are breaking changes

- if released symbol is removed completely
- width of the released component changes (causing other elements possibly flowing to new row)
- typography changes (e.g. font-size, font weight, letter-spacing ) on already existing styles
- changing spacing outside the element (margins)
- overridable elements are changed/removed (this causes overrides to be reset in symbol instances)

These are not breaking changes

- symbol structure is updated (e.g. layer order) but nothing is removed
- changing padding inside the element, so that the outside stays the same size
- symbol name or symbol hierarchy is changed
- layer names are changed

### Implementation

These are breaking changes

- properties are removed completely
- renaming existing components or properties
- changes in component box model
- if it is a breaking change in design, it most likely is also in the implementation
- updating dependency so that previous versions are not supported anymore

These are not breaking changes

- new optional properties or features are added
- bug fixes that donâ€™t change the names of the properties or remove functionality
- marking something deprecated. It will a become breaking change when it is actually removed
