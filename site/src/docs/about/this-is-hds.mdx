## How we work
Helsinki Design System -team is a collaboration of professionals from different consultancies and City of Helsinki. City of Helsinki didn't buy ready design system but rather decided to gather the best professionals in the same team. This way City of Helsinki owns and continues to maintain the design system.
When the people change, it is important that the processes but also the actual design system are well documented, so that it is possible to transfer the knowledge

HDS is developed as open source project so anyone can benefit from it. The source code is available in <Link href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system" external size="M" > Github </Link>free of charge and even the designs are shared for those who are interested. Building open source design system has many valuable points:
- Open source is one way to share the benefits to larger community
- Open source projects enables collaboration with other cities and companies as well, allowing contributions from the community
- Open source creates transparency

A key principle is to pay attention accessibility all the way from the first drafts to the final component. Accessibility specialists audit every component before we release it.
(accessibility process image here).

Collaboration and support are built-in in the processes. City of Helsinki has a dedicated slack-channel to handle discussion and requests from the projects across the city organization.
