### Component lib

- "platforms" as separate packages: core, react
- other option to have components as separate packages, but is there a benefit in this?
- "compiled" js or just source code?

### Tools

- Babel
- ESLint + Prettier
- Jest + Enzyme
- CSS Modules / SCSS Modules (vars?)
- Storybook
- Typescript?
- i18next?
